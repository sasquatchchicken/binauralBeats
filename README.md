# binauralBeats
This repository contains a Python script for generating and simulating binaural beats, which are specific audio frequencies used to influence mental states and facilitate altered consciousness. The script allows users to interactively experience binaural beats by specifying base frequency, binaural frequency, and duration.

## Background
The Monroe Institute, has extensively researched the use of **binaural beats** to induce altered states of consciousness. Binaural beats involve playing slightly different frequencies in each ear to create a perceived third frequency inside the brain.

## Features
**Binaural Beat Generation:** Create stereo binaural beat tones using specified frequencies.

**Playback Functionality:** Utilize the sounddevice library to play generated binaural beats.

**Interactive Simulation:** Users can input parameters to experience binaural beats in real-time.

## Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Required libraries: numpy, sounddevice
## Installation
**Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sasquatchchicken/binaural-beat-simulator.git
cd binaural-beat-simulator
```
**Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install numpy sounddevice
```
## Usage
**Run the simulator:**
```bash
python binaural_beat_simulator.py
```
Follow the on-screen instructions to input the base frequency, binaural frequency, and duration of the binaural beat simulation.

Additional Notes
For more information on specific frequencies used by the Monroe Institute or advanced techniques in consciousness exploration, refer to their official materials.
**Exercise caution and prioritize personal well-being when experimenting with altered states of consciousness or meditation techniques.**
