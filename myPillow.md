## FIRST AFFIRMATION

**Say in your mind, say to yourself: I am more than my physical body. 
Because I am more than physical matter, I can perceive that which is greater than the Physical world. 
Therefore, in these exercises, I deeply desire To Expand, To Experience; To Know, To Understand; 
To Control, To Use such greater energies and energy systems as may be beneficial and constructive to me 
and those who follow me. Also during these exercises, I deeply desire the help and cooperation, 
the assistance, the understanding of those individuals whose wisdom, development and experience is equal 
or greater than my own. I ask their guidance and protection from any influence or any source that might 
provide me with less than my stated desire. I now protect myself as may be needed from such influence 
and reject any source that may restrain me from my stated desires.**
